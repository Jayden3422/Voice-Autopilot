# Frequently Asked Questions -- General

## About Jayden

### What is Jayden?
Jayden is an AI-powered voice assistant and support automation platform. We help businesses automate customer interactions through voice calls, chat, and messaging channels using advanced natural language processing and voice synthesis technology. Our platform handles everything from answering simple questions to scheduling appointments and resolving support tickets.

### How is Jayden different from a traditional IVR system?
Traditional IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems use rigid phone trees that force callers to press buttons or speak specific keywords. Jayden is a conversational AI -- customers speak naturally, and our assistant understands context, handles complex requests, and maintains fluid conversations. There is no "Press 1 for billing." Instead, customers simply say what they need.

### What languages does Jayden support?
Jayden supports 28 languages, including English, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malay, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Czech, Greek, Hebrew, Romanian, and Ukrainian. The Starter plan includes 5 languages, the Pro plan includes 15, and the Enterprise plan includes all 28.

### Can Jayden handle both inbound and outbound calls?
Yes. Jayden handles inbound calls (customers calling your business) and outbound calls (proactive outreach such as appointment reminders, survey calls, follow-ups, and promotional campaigns). Outbound calling is available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Getting Started

### How long does it take to set up Jayden?
Most businesses can get up and running in under an hour. The basic setup involves three steps: connecting your knowledge base (uploading documents or linking your help center), configuring your voice assistant persona, and connecting to your phone system or website. Enterprise deployments with custom integrations typically take 2-4 weeks.

### Do I need technical expertise to use Jayden?
No. The Jayden dashboard is designed for non-technical users. You can configure your assistant, build conversation flows, manage your knowledge base, and view analytics without writing any code. For advanced customization, we offer API access and webhook support for developers.

### Is there a free trial?
Yes. We offer a 14-day free trial on all plans with full access to features. No credit card is required to start the trial. At the end of the trial, you can choose a paid plan or your account will be paused (data is retained for 30 days).

### Can I import my existing FAQ or knowledge base?
Absolutely. Jayden supports importing content from:
- Markdown files (.md)
- PDF documents
- Word documents (.docx)
- HTML pages
- CSV files
- Zendesk help center articles
- Notion pages
- Confluence spaces

Simply upload your files or connect your existing platform, and Jayden will index the content for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Billing and Account

### How does billing work?
Jayden bills monthly or annually based on your chosen plan. Charges are based on the number of AI-handled interactions per month. Annual billing provides a 15% discount. You can view your usage and billing details in the Jayden dashboard under **Account > Billing**.

### What counts as an "interaction"?
An interaction is a single customer conversation from start to finish, regardless of length. If a customer calls, asks three questions, and hangs up, that counts as one interaction. If the same customer calls back an hour later, that counts as a second interaction. Transferred calls where the AI hands off to a human agent still count as one interaction.

### Can I change my plan at any time?
Yes. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time from the dashboard. Upgrades take effect immediately and billing is pro-rated. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

### What happens if I exceed my monthly interaction limit?
You will not experience any service disruption. Additional interactions beyond your plan limit are billed as overage at the per-interaction rate for your plan ($0.25/interaction on Starter, $0.15/interaction on Pro). You can set an overage cap in your billing settings to control costs.

### Do you offer refunds?
We offer a pro-rated refund within the first 30 days if you are not satisfied. After 30 days, you may cancel at any time but refunds are not provided for the current billing period. Annual plan refunds are calculated on a pro-rated basis.

## Data and Privacy

### Where is my data stored?
By default, customer data is stored in our cloud infrastructure hosted on AWS with data centers in the United States (us-east-1) and the European Union (eu-west-1). Enterprise customers can choose their preferred data region or opt for on-premise deployment.

### Does Jayden record and store conversations?
Yes, conversation transcripts and audio recordings are stored for quality assurance and analytics purposes. You can configure data retention policies in the dashboard. The default retention period is 30 days on Starter, 12 months on Pro, and custom on Enterprise. You may also disable recording entirely if required.

### Is Jayden GDPR compliant?
Yes. Jayden is fully GDPR compliant. We offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for all customers. Features include consent management, data subject access requests, right to erasure, and data portability. See our [Security and Compliance](./10_security_compliance.md) page for full details.

### Can I delete customer data?
Yes. You can delete individual customer records, conversation transcripts, and recordings at any time through the dashboard or API. Bulk deletion tools are available for managing data at scale. Deleted data is permanently removed within 30 days.
