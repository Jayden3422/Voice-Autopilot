## Service Level Agreements (SLA)

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **P1 -- Critical** | Complete service outage or data loss affecting production. Business operations are halted. | Platform is completely down; all calls failing; data breach detected |
| **P2 -- High** | Major feature degraded or unavailable. Significant business impact with no workaround. | Voice assistant not responding on one channel; integrations failing; analytics not loading |
| **P3 -- Medium** | Feature partially impaired. Business impact is moderate and a workaround exists. | Slow response times; intermittent errors; one integration disconnected |
| **P4 -- Low** | Minor issue, cosmetic defect, or general question. Minimal business impact. | Dashboard display issue; feature request; documentation question |

### Response and Resolution Times

| Severity | Starter Response | Pro Response | Enterprise Response | Enterprise Resolution Target |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| P1 | 24 hours | 4 hours | **30 minutes** | 4 hours |
| P2 | 24 hours | 4 hours | **1 hour** | 8 hours |
| P3 | 48 hours | 8 hours | **4 hours** | 48 hours |
| P4 | 72 hours | 24 hours | **8 hours** | 5 business days |

**Note**: Response time is the time from ticket creation to first substantive response from a support engineer (not an automated acknowledgment). Resolution target is the time to resolve or provide a viable workaround.

## SLA Credits

Enterprise customers are eligible for SLA credits if we fail to meet our committed response or resolution times.

| SLA Miss | Credit |
|----------|--------|
| Response time exceeded by up to 2x | 5% of monthly fee |
| Response time exceeded by more than 2x | 10% of monthly fee |
| Platform uptime below 99.99% in a calendar month | 10% of monthly fee |
| Platform uptime below 99.9% in a calendar month | 25% of monthly fee |
| Platform uptime below 99.0% in a calendar month | 50% of monthly fee |

Credits are applied to the next billing cycle and must be requested within 30 days of the incident. Credits do not apply during scheduled maintenance windows, which are announced at least 72 hours in advance.

## Escalation Procedures

If you feel your issue is not being handled appropriately, you can escalate through the following chain:

1. **Level 1**: Request escalation to a Senior Support Engineer via your current ticket.
2. **Level 2**: Contact the Support Manager at support-escalation@Jayden.com.
3. **Level 3**: Contact the VP of Customer Success at cs-leadership@Jayden.com.
4. **Level 4** (Enterprise only): Contact your dedicated Account Manager directly.

Escalations are acknowledged within 2 hours during business hours.

## Scheduled Maintenance

Jayden performs scheduled maintenance during low-traffic windows to minimize disruption:
- **Maintenance Window**: Sundays, 2:00 AM -- 6:00 AM EST
- **Notification**: At least 72 hours advance notice via email and status page
- **Impact**: Most maintenance is zero-downtime. If downtime is required, the expected duration is communicated in advance.
